## Core Concept and Premise
A contemporary fantasy novel exploring the consequences of magical preservation gone wrong. Elinora Parker, a young historian, discovers she's heir to one of the last viable magical bloodlines when she receives a damaged pendant missing its central crystal. The pendant, covered in unreadable symbols and created by the Last Wizard as a failsafe against magic's extinction, leads her to recognize its connection to her grandmother's crystal brooch, now in her Aunt Margaret's possession. As she seeks to unite the pieces, she turns to her lifelong friend Rowan Cooper, a former Army Ranger now seeking a peaceful life as a technical writer. Their deep friendship, dating back to a childhood blue crayon incident, becomes both strength and witness as they experience the dramatic magical reunion of the pendant pieces. Only after the pendant is complete do Elinora's true magical abilities awaken, revealing the meaning of the symbols through dreams and connecting her to historical events. Through her journey, she must master the complex interplay of bloodline requirements, physical catalysts, and the fundamental constraints of magical energy while dealing with the Order of Thorn, a once-powerful organization whose own efforts to preserve magic ironically led to its decline. The story examines the tension between preservation and progress, the unintended consequences of extreme measures, and the challenge of reviving a nearly-lost art in the modern world, while exploring how family histories and deep personal connections can influence magical power and become catalysts for extraordinary abilities.
