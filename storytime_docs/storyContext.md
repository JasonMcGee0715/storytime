# Story Context
*Generated from initial plot implementation*

## Core Concept and Premise
A contemporary fantasy novel exploring the consequences of magical preservation gone wrong. Elinora, a young historian, discovers she's heir to one of the last viable magical bloodlines through a pendant created by the Last Wizard - a failsafe against magic's extinction. As she awakens to her heritage, she must navigate both the natural laws governing magic (the Power Balance Law and Chaos Effect) and the attention of the Order of Thorn, a once-powerful organization whose own efforts to preserve magic ironically led to its decline. The story examines the tension between preservation and progress, the unintended consequences of extreme measures, and the challenge of reviving a nearly-lost art in the modern world.
