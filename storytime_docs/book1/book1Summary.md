# Book 1: The Awakening

## Overview
Book 1 chronicles the journey of Elinora and Rowan from their ordinary lives into a world of magic, ancient powers, and global conflict. When Elinora receives a mysterious ancient amulet disk covered in shifting patterns that defy normal physics and photography, she discovers her aunt possesses a pendant that fits perfectly into its center, causing new patterns to emerge. The disk's enigmatic symbols, which respond to magical energy and reveal different aspects under varying conditions, become both a guide and a mystery throughout their journey.
